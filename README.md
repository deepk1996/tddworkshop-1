# Actual problem

Hi, I'm Kapil Sharma. This repository represent notes, exercises for TDD Workshop for PHP Reboot.

> Warning: All code and notes are committed in this repository. However if you really wish to learn TDD, please do not to look up the code. Code is there to just help you out in case you are badly stuck and can't find a way out.

This file is the starting point and you must move forward as suggested in ths file.

This short course expect you have decent knowledge of PHP. However if you do not have knowledge of git, composer, PHP Unit or any other things required in this course, its basics will be covered to get you started.

# Project

Please note, we are not going to make a commercial project. Project for this course is just a learning project, that we will make with TDD approach. Along with TDD, we will also supposed to follow all latest coding guidelines and standards.

So we are going to make a command line calculator. We will start with minimal functionality and with time, add other features in our command line calculator.

However we will pick one task at a time. Lets start with task 1

# Task 1

We need to make a command line utility to sum zero to two numbers. Command should be

```bash
php calculator.php sum
php calculator.php sum 1
php calculator.php sum 2,3
```

and its output must 0, 1, and 5 respectively.

With problem statement clear, lets make it.

Go ahead and check if you can do it.

Once you are done please proceed to [task2](task2.md).

## Solution

I recommend not to check the solution until you try it yourself. However if you are stuck or want to see how I did it, please go through [Task 1 solution](task1solution.md).

# Get your code reviewed

(Optional step)

To get your code reviewed by me, it must be open source project, committed on github.

Once committed, let me know and ask me to review your code. As soon as I get some time, I'll check your code and let you know if there are some improvement points. To tell me about your code, just tweet

> @phpreboot check TDD workshop code at <Github repo URL>

(and follow me on twitter. LOL just kidding, that's not necessary.)
