# PHP Reboot Test Driven Development Workshop

This is task 1 of Test driven development workshop.

## Most important

Our tasks are very simple. However in this workshop, we need to confirm we are following TDD approach. Also, we must follow all coding best practices and after completion of task, must refactor our solution. Steps should be:

  - Make test
  - Code
  - Test
  - Refactor
  - Test
  - Go to next task.

## Task 1

We need to make a command line utility to sum zero to two numbers. Command should be

```bash
php calculator.php sum
php calculator.php sum 1
php calculator.php sum 2,3
```

and its output must 0, 1, and 5 respectively.

With problem statement clear, lets make it.

Go ahead and check if you can do it.

Once you are done please proceed to [task2](task2.md).

## Task 1 solution

If you are stuck, I'd provided [solution for task 1](task1solution.md). However I strongly recommend to first try yourself and check solution only if you are badly stuck or validate your solution.s
